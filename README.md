This project is aim to introduce myself to the user of this website and the site's user will be considering to hire me. Therefore, in my website I show some details about me, the project I've done before and the certification I achived. Other than this, as I am interested design related staff and in future I hope to have a job that is related to design. Thus, through this website I also trying to show my talent of designing website. 
 
## Design Process
Firstly, before I start planning on the layout of content in my website, I choose a nice background for every pages of my website. Then, my whole website color scheme will all be based on the color on my background. 

Furthermore, this website is also design for my future needs and serve as my resume. Therefore, in this website I aim to make it possible, so instead having everything in a page, I split them into different pages, even if the content in every pages now is little but in the future it will be easier for me to add on.

After finished all this basic plan, I start planning on the nav bar design, layout of every pages, and what I should put in every pages. The wireframe of the webite deisgn is in the same file as where all the html,css and js stay in.

As this website is somehow serve as my resume, as it aim to attract my future employer. Therefore, the first main key of my about me webpage design is eyes-catching. To achive this main key, I take refereces on the design of hero section and implement in my website from a youtuber call WEB CIFAR. Link of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFQkb26UD1Y

After I achived my first main key, I then aim to present my details in a simple but organise ways. This will make my website look clean and the user will be able to know what does this part of detail trying to present what in the first glance.

Moreover, for some details such as project, as I think it is more important than others details. Therefore, I want it to oustand from other project, so I decided put my project into a card, and each card will be represent one project I've done before. Through this card the user will be able to see detail of the project and a button to allow the user to learn more about the project. For this card design I was inspired by https://rog.asus.com/sg/ and the animation of the card was reference from a video from youtuber call Kevin Powell, the link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEq5cWNYt8.
