# Your Project's Name


This project aims to introduce myself to the user of this website and the site's users will be considering hiring me. Therefore, on my website, I show some details about me, the project I've done before and the certification I achieved. Other than this, as I am interested in design-related staff and in future, I hope to have a job that is related to design. Thus, through this website, I also try to show my talent in designing websites. 
 
## Design Process
Firstly, before I start planning on the layout of content in my website, I choose a nice background for every page of my website. Then, my whole website colour scheme will all be based on the colour of my background. 

Furthermore, this website is also designed for my future needs and serve as my resume. Therefore, in this website, I aim to make it possible, so instead of having everything on a page, I split them into different pages, even if the content on every page now is little but in the future, it will be easier for me to add on.

After finishing all this basic plan, I start planning on the navbar design, the layout of every page, and what I should put on every page. The wireframe of the website design is in the same file as to where all the Html, CSS and JS stay in.

This website somehow serves as my resume, as it aims to attract my future employer. Therefore, the first main key of my about me webpage design is eye-catching. To achieve this main key, I take references on the design of the hero section and implement in my website from a YouTuber call WEB CIFAR. Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFQkb26UD1Y

After I achieved my first main key, I then aim to present my details in simple but organised ways. This will make my website look clean and the user will be able to know what does this part of detail trying to present at first glance.

Moreover, for some details such as project, as I think it is more important than others details. Therefore, I want it to outstand from other stuff, so I decided to put my project into a card, and each card will represent one project I've done before. Through this card, the user will be able to see details of the project and a button to allow the user to learn more about the project. For this card design, I was inspired by https://rog.asus.com/sg/ and the animation of the card was referenced from a video from a Youtuber called Kevin Powell, the link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEq5cWNYt8.


## Features
Firstly, My navbar button will be kept inside a burger when the screen is small, and it will have a smooth animation that shows all buttons when clicking on the burger logo.
Secondly, I have a home page, this homepage will welcome the user.
Thirdly, I have about page. This page will talk about me and about the website. When the user gets inside the page, will have a short introduction of my name and a cool animation on my Chinese name.
Last but not least,  I have a Portfolio page. On this page, as normal I will have a hero section and it states the aim of this page. Apart from the hero section, I split the rest of the content into 2 different sections, My certification and My project. For my certification, it will display in the gallery and for my project, each project will be represented as a card, and when the user interacts with it will show a brief description of my project and a button to allow the user to learn more about it that project.
